INTRODUCTION					*gina-introduction*

*gina* is a git manipulation plugin which uses job feature of Neovim and Vim
to support async process call.

INTERFACE					*gina-interface*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*gina-commands*

						*:Gina*
:Gina[!] {command} [{options}]
	Call {command} with {options}.
	It call a gina command of {command} when {command} is found under
	the namespace "gina#command#".
	Otherwise it call a raw {command} ("git {command} {options}") and
	echo the result. It immediately call a raw {command} rather than a
	gina command even if there are {command} is found if a bang (!) has
	specified.

						*:Gina-branch*
:Gina branch [{options}]
	Open a "gina-branch" buffer to list and manipulate branches.

=============================================================================
ASKPASS						*gina-askpass*

When git requires username or password (e.g. git pull on a repository linked
with https://), it use a program called "askpass".
While gina.vim execute a git command through a job feature, a terminal based
askpass program which git provides cannot be used.
To solve this issue, gina.vim try to use a GUI based askpass program instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
LINUX						*gina-askpass-linux*

There is a well known GUI based askpass program called "ssh-askpass-gnome".
Users should install the program and set the executable path to one of these

1. "$GIT_ASKPASS" environment variable
2. "core.askpass" with "git config --global core.askpass=..."
3. "$SSH_ASKPASS" environment variable

When no available askpass program could be detected from above, gina.vim use
an internal askpass script based on "zenity" when "zenity" is executable.
Otherwise a git command which requires username and/or password always fail.

In short, Linux users should do one of

- Install "ssh-askpass-gnome" and configure it properly
- Install "zenity"

To enable username and/or password interactive input.

See "scripts/askpass.zenity" if you would like to check what the script does.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAC						*gina-askpass-mac*

gina.vim provides an internal askpass script based on an AppleScript.
The script should be available on any Unix based Mac.

In short, Mac uses should do nothing to enable username and/or password
interactive input.

See "scripts/askpass.mac" if you would like to check what the script does.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS						*gina-askpass-windows*

There is a GUI based askpass program called "win-ssh-askpass".
Users should install the program and set executable path to one of these

1. "$GIT_ASKPASS" environment variable
2. "core.askpass" with "git config --global core.askpass=..."
3. "$SSH_ASKPASS" environment variable

When no available askpass program could be detected from above, gina.vim use
an internal askpass script (Not implemented yet).
Otherwise a git command which requires username and/or password always fail.

Additionally, while Windows does not provide Unix's "env" like command, users
should set "$GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT" environment variable to "0" by themselves.
See |gina-askpass-GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT| for more detail.

In short, Windows users should

1. Install "win-ssh-askpass" and configure it properly
2. Add "let $GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT = '0'" to somewhere in your vimrc

To enable username and/or password interactive input.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT			 *gina-askpass-GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT*

A git fallback to use a builtin terminal based askpass program when git
failed to use a specified askpass OR when a specified askpass program returns
an empty value.
So the terminal based askpass program will called when user cancel GUI based
askpass program and gina.vim cannot treat the terminal based askpass program
correctly.
So users should set "$GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT = 0" to tell git to disable the
terminal based askpass program.

In Unix-like platform (Linux/Mac), it is configured by gina.vim automatically
while an "env" command is available on this platform to temporary set the
environment variable. So users do not need to consider about this.

In Windows, it is not configured automatically due to the lack of "env" like
program on this platform. So users SHOULD configure this environment variable
by themselves.

However $GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT disable a terminal based askpass program,
indicating that configure it without assinging a proper askpass program to
$GIT_ASKPASS, core.askpass, or $SSH_ASKPASS would make it impossible to input
username and/or password when git requires.
That's why the $GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT should be configured only in the Vim's
live session. To do that, use |let-$| syntax to configure it in Vim like
>
	let $GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT = "0"
<
Note that :terminal command in Neovim or :VimShell command provided by
Shougo/vimshell.vim would be effected by the setting above as well.
